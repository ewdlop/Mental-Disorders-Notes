Imposter syndrome is a psychological pattern where individuals doubt their accomplishments and have a persistent fear of being exposed as a "fraud." While PsychoPy is typically used for creating experiments in cognitive and behavioral psychology, it can also be used to create interactive tasks or simulations to study phenomena like imposter syndrome.

Here’s an example of how you can create a simple experiment in PsychoPy to investigate imposter syndrome. This example will involve presenting participants with tasks and asking them to rate their confidence and perceived competence.

### Steps to Create an Imposter Syndrome Experiment in PsychoPy

1. **Install PsychoPy**: Ensure you have PsychoPy installed. You can install it via pip:
   ```sh
   pip install psychopy
   ```

2. **Create the Experiment**:
   - Start PsychoPy and open the Builder view for a graphical interface, or use the Coder view for scripting.

3. **Design the Experiment**:
   - **Introduction Screen**: Explain the task to the participants.
   - **Task Screen**: Present a series of tasks or questions.
   - **Confidence Rating Screen**: Ask participants to rate their confidence after each task.
   - **Competence Rating Screen**: Ask participants to rate their perceived competence.

### Example Code

Here’s a simple script using PsychoPy's Coder view:

```python
from psychopy import visual, event, core, gui

# Create a window
win = visual.Window(size=(800, 600), color=(1, 1, 1), fullscr=False)

# Create an introduction text
intro_text = visual.TextStim(win, text="Welcome to the Imposter Syndrome Study!\n\n"
                                       "You will be presented with a series of tasks.\n"
                                       "After each task, you will rate your confidence and perceived competence.\n\n"
                                       "Press any key to continue.", color=(-1, -1, -1))
intro_text.draw()
win.flip()
event.waitKeys()

# List of tasks
tasks = [
    "Task 1: Solve the math problem 3 + 5",
    "Task 2: Solve the math problem 7 - 2",
    "Task 3: Solve the math problem 6 * 4"
]

# Function to display a task and get ratings
def run_task(task_text):
    task_stim = visual.TextStim(win, text=task_text, color=(-1, -1, -1))
    task_stim.draw()
    win.flip()
    event.waitKeys()

    # Confidence rating
    confidence_rating = gui.DlgFromDict({"Confidence (1-10)": "5"}, title="Confidence Rating")
    if confidence_rating.OK:
        confidence = confidence_rating.data[0]
    else:
        core.quit()

    # Competence rating
    competence_rating = gui.DlgFromDict({"Competence (1-10)": "5"}, title="Competence Rating")
    if competence_rating.OK:
        competence = competence_rating.data[0]
    else:
        core.quit()

    return confidence, competence

# Run tasks and collect ratings
results = []
for task in tasks:
    confidence, competence = run_task(task)
    results.append((task, confidence, competence))

# Display results
result_text = "Results:\n"
for task, confidence, competence in results:
    result_text += f"{task}\nConfidence: {confidence}, Competence: {competence}\n\n"

result_stim = visual.TextStim(win, text=result_text, color=(-1, -1, -1))
result_stim.draw()
win.flip()

# Wait for a key press to end
event.waitKeys()

# Close the window
win.close()
core.quit()
```

### Explanation

1. **Introduction Screen**: A `TextStim` object is created to display the introductory text. The program waits for any key press before proceeding.
2. **Task Screen**: Tasks are presented one by one using a list of task descriptions.
3. **Confidence Rating**: After each task, a dialog box (`DlgFromDict`) is used to collect the participant's confidence rating.
4. **Competence Rating**: Another dialog box is used to collect the participant's perceived competence rating.
5. **Results Display**: After all tasks are completed, the results are displayed on the screen, showing the tasks and the corresponding ratings.

This example provides a basic structure for studying imposter syndrome using PsychoPy. You can expand this experiment by adding more tasks, using more sophisticated rating methods, or incorporating other psychological measures. If you need more advanced features or have specific requirements for your study, feel free to ask!
